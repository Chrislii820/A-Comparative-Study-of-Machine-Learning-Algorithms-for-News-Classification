This is the README of this project. 
Each folder contains each jupyter notebook for different models.

This project presents a comparative study of machine learning algorithms for news classification.
Evaluating the performance of several popular classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), LSTM, and BERT, on 7600 samples and trained the models with random 16000 samples from ag_news which consisted of 120000 news articles from 4 different categories.
